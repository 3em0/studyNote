		Write your own custom rich components with built-in AJAX support
		</f:facet>
		The CDK includes a code-generation facility and a
		templating facility using a JSP-like syntax. These capabilities help
		to avoid a routine process of a component creation. The component factory
		works like a well-oiled machine allowing the creation of first-class
		rich components with built-in Ajax functionality even more easily than
		the creation of simpler components by means of the traditional coding
		approach.
