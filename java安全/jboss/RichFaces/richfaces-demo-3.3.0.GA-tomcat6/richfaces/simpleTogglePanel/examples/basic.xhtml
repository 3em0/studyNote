		The framework is implemented by using a component library. The library
		set Ajax functionality into existing pages, so there is no need to write
		any JavaScript code or to replace existing components with new Ajax one. 
		Ajax4jsf enables page-wide Ajax support instead of the traditional 
		component-wide support and it gives the opportunity to define the event 
		on the page. An event invokes an Ajax request and areas of the page 
		which are synchronized with the JSF Component Tree after changing the 
		data on the server by Ajax request in accordance with events fired on 
		the client.
